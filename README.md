# election_2018_forecast

Here is my forecast.

I expect that Democrats will win the House clearly, but in a closer race that is predicted by Professor Enos. There has been a recent push in calls to vote from the Deomcratic side and, if Harvard's situation can be generalised, the student population has had a boost in formal, bureaucratic civic engagement rather than informal protest and enti-establishment rhetoric. We have seen in recent elections that the student population is overwhelmingly liberal. Given this, I expect a higher than previous Democratic vote share. 

I expect that the Republicans will win the Senate in a close race.
